## HW2: Hill Cipher

Transform the text in matrix, and use a encrypted matrix to encrypted the text by multiplication. Decode as the same way by using invert encrypted matrix.

## HW3: Cosine Transform

Build Cosine Transform matrix and use it to transform time domain signal to frequency domain. Then filter the signal to get the most significant 5 frequency.
